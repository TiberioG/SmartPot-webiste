Here is the introductory report of our project.

### Short description of the concept  
SmartPot is an intelligent watering system for flower pots. It uses a soil humidity sensor to calculate if the flower needs more water. Then it has a water reservoir and a pump to water the plant when needed


### Description of how you arrived at your design

<p>The first idea was creating a moving flower pot, with light photodiodes all around the base to get which side was the brightest and then make the pot move toward the light. It was a cool idea, but not for the plant, since it would have been disoriented. That's because plants tend to grow in the direction of light so if the pot moves, the plant would never know where to grow. </p>
<p>So we decided to create something to solve another problem: watering of plants. People may find it really hard to remember watering their plants on time or they may leave their house for a long time so that they can't keep the plants alive. It will be helpful to have a tool to help them watering their plants, totally automated.</p>
