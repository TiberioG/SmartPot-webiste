Here is the summary report of our project.

## Aim of project

The aim of our project is to create an intelligent automated flower pot, which waters the soil automatically when detects it dry. We have not changed the aim of the project since the introductory report. We wanted to create also our own humidity sensor,

## Final project

### Sensor


###Enclosure

 We designed a case with integrated water reservoir, the pump and a semi-circular water dispenser. Jussi designed the 3D model and we printed in Fablab.
=======
## Final product
We have, 4 parts in our final design: a sensor, a reservoir, a water dispenser and a flower pot.   
#### 3D modeling
Jussi did the [3D model](https://github.com/txjt/SmartPot/tree/master/models/Concept2) design with Autodesk Fushion. 
### schematics & PCB
Tapio created [schematics](https://github.com/txjt/SmartPot/blob/master/SmartPot_schematics.pdf) and designed the [pcb](https://github.com/txjt/SmartPot/blob/master/DigiFab_no_MCU.pdf) and milled it with Teberio and Xiao by using Roland milling machine. Tapio and Tiberio tested the sensor and collected [data](https://github.com/txjt/SmartPot/tree/master/%20osclilloscope) for software. Tiberio did the [software](https://github.com/txjt/SmartPot/tree/master/software) of the sensor board.
#### Sensor
Teberio and Tapio tested the sensor with soil in different humidity and caculated propriate parameters for sensor software.

#### Enclosure
Tiberio and Xiao printed the reservoir and its attached base of the flower pot. Jussi did the last printing of the arm and then we finally assemble the components together.
