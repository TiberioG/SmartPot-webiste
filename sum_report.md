Here is the summary report of our project.

## Aim of project

The aim of our project is to create an intelligent automated flower pot, which waters the soil automatically when detects it dry. We have not changed the aim of the project since the introductory report. We wanted to create also our own humidity sensor,


## Final product
We have, 4 parts in our final design: a sensor, a reservior, a water dispenser and a flower pot.   
Jussi did the [3D model](https://github.com/txjt/SmartPot/tree/master/models/Concept2) design with Autodesk Fushion. Tapio created [schematics](https://github.com/txjt/SmartPot/blob/master/SmartPot_schematics.pdf) and designed the [pcb](https://github.com/txjt/SmartPot/blob/master/DigiFab_no_MCU.pdf) and milled it with Teberio and Xiao by using Roland milling machine. Tapio and Tiberio tested the sensor and collected [data](https://github.com/txjt/SmartPot/tree/master/%20osclilloscope) for software. After Tiberio finishing the [software](https://github.com/txjt/SmartPot/tree/master/software) of the sensor board, he also printed the reservor and its attached base of the flower pot with Xiao. Jussi did the last printing of the arm and then we finally assemble the components together.
### Sensor


###Enclosure
 We designed a case with integrated water reservoir, the pump and a semi-circular water dispenser. Jussi designed the 3D model and we printed in Fablab.
