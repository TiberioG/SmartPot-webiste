After testing the sensor with oscilloscope we need to design the circuit to control it with the Arduino.
since the capacitance is very small, we need a very fast processing. We checked the speed of the ADC of Arduino nano and it's too slow for what we need. Tapio comes up with the idea of using the internal analog comparator of ATMEL microcontroller. We will read the time constant this way: firs we put a 5V voltage step on one sensor and we compare the one delayed by capacitance with a reference signal.
