<p>This week, we worked together in fablab and printed a small gear for testing. Since Tepio and Jussi have more experience on dealing with PCB and 3D printing, we quickly went thougth the procedure of 3D modeling and printing. Zifan and Tiberio read more tutorials on both 2D and 3D modeling and simulated a few examples. Then, we added more details on the sketches. The idea is to use a normal plower pot with an additional part attached to the bottom which has a pump, tank and a pipe goes from the tank to the top of this flower pot. The pump is controled by an arduino UNO with a humidity sensor.
