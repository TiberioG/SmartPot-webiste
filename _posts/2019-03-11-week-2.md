<p>This week, we worked together in fablab and printed a small gear for testing. Since Tepio and Jussi have more experience on dealing with PCB and 3D printing, we quickly went thougth the procedure of 3D modeling and printing.

Tiberio and Zifan read more tutorials on both 2D and 3D modeling and simulated a few examples. Then, we added more details on the sketches and changed the design of the water supply. </p>
<p> We thought about printing a new pot for our design which would use more raw material and not so good as using a finished one.  </p>
<p>>The new idea is using a normal flower pot with an additional part attached to the bottom which has a pump, tank and a pipe goes from the tank to the top of this flower pot. The pump is controled by an arduino UNO with a humidity sensor. We think this idea is better, because it's much more convenient to attach this part to bottom of a normal flower pot rather than remaining a reservoir on the top.

<p>And we did find a normal size flower pot for testing!</p>
