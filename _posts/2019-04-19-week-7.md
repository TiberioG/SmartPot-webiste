This week Jussi finishes the new design of the flower pot. We have now on the bottom a water reservoir with an aperture to fill the water in a easy way without opening the assembly. Inside the arm we hide the peristaltic pump and there is also room for an Arduino Uno, even though we plan to not use it because we have our sensor board with everything we need to control the pump and sensor. the design of water dispenser is now more sleek and semi-circular, to give more room to the plant to grow.

For the sensor, even though the milling process was not 100% successful, Tapio and Tiberio fix it by hand.
