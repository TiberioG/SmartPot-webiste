The code for the Arduino creates a square wave for sensor and for reference, then we use a library that calls an interrupt function when the voltage of sensor becomes equal to the reference.
We measure time at beginning of each loop cycle and when the interrupts starts so we can calculate the time constant as difference of those times.

Also we print the last part of model:
