<h3>Electronics</h3>
Tapio starts working on the PCB design for the sensor. We need to have a PCB with two conductive lines close together so we can measure the voltage between them that changes when the soil changes in humidity. We think about putting the micro-controller directly on top of the sensor to avoid problems with parasite capacitance due to long connection cables.

<h3>Documentation</h3>

Tiberio and Xiao work on the presentation, at the beginning we thought using a PPT, but than we choose to show the website, repo and the first 3D model.
