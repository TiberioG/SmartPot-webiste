Here is the introductory report of our project.

### Short description of the concept  
SmartPot is an intelligent watering system for flower pots. It uses a soil humidity sensor to calculate if the flower needs more water.


### Description of how you arrived at your design

The first idea was creating a moving flower pot, with light photodiodes all around to get which side was the brightest and then make the pot move toward the light. It was a cool idea but not for the plant since it would have been disoriented.
